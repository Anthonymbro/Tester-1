            <h1>Anthony's Website</h1>
            <p>This is a pseudo-website dedicated to the experiments I make with coding. I also put a "br" tag here to separate different elements</p><br/><p>I can style my paragraphs with <b>bold writing</b> and <i>italics writing.</i> and make my writing either <big>big</big> or <small>small.</small> We can also do subscripts or superscripts. These can be useful for things like math writing or chemistry. Like H<sub>2</sub>0 to make the small numbers de-elevate a level and elevate a level like in making powers of numbers like 5<sup>9</sup>.
